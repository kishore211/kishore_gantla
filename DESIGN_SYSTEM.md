# Portfolio Design System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive, unified card design system across the entire portfolio website to address visual consistency issues and enhance overall polish and professionalism.

## Problems Addressed
1. **Inconsistent Card Backgrounds**: Cards throughout different sections had varying background colors, shadows, and styling
2. **Poor Visual Hierarchy**: Section backgrounds didn't provide enough contrast with card content
3. **Flat Design**: Cards lacked depth and visual interest due to inconsistent shadow usage
4. **Disconnected Aesthetics**: Different sections looked unrelated due to styling variations

## Design System Implementation

### Core Card Classes
```css
.card {
  @apply bg-gray-50 rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-100 transition-all duration-300;
}

.card-hover {
  @apply hover:shadow-md hover:-translate-y-1;
}

.card-featured {
  @apply bg-blue-50 border-blue-100;
}

.card-interactive {
  @apply hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-2 cursor-pointer;
}
```

### Section Background Classes
```css
.section-light {
  @apply bg-white;
}

.section-gray {
  @apply bg-gray-50;
}

.section-accent {
  @apply bg-gradient-to-br from-primary-50 to-purple-50;
}
```
